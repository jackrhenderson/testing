## Product Configuration

![Product](./modules/servers/solusiovps/docs/product.png)

Create a product in WHMCS and select `SolusIO VPS` as the linked module and the server group you configured previous.

Select the `Plan`, `Default Location` and `Default Operating System` or `Application` and save changes. If application is selected then the operating system is ignored.

### Optional Configuration

#### Locations

The module gives the ability to select a specific location on ordering of a product. This is done in the form of configurable options.

![Location](./modules/servers/solusiovps/docs/option-location.png)

Create a configurable option named `Location`. Add options with the following convention: `locationId|locationName`. This will take priority over selected location in product module settings.

#### Operating Systems

The module gives the ability to select a specific operating system on ordering of a product. This is done in the form of configurable options.

![Operating System](./modules/servers/solusiovps/docs/option-os.png)

Create a configurable option named `Operating System`. Add options with the following convention: `osId|osName`. This will take priority over selected operating system in product module settings.

#### SSH Key

The module gives the ability to specify an SSH key on ordering of a product. This is done in the form a product custom field.

Create a custom field named `SSH Key` and type `Text Area`.

#### Applications

Create corresponding product custom fields for applications with the same property names as defined in SolusIO.

## Other configurations

There are several options that can be configured within module config file `config.php`

- `delete_solus_user` - request SolusIO user deletion when user account is terminated if the value is set to `true`
- `default_domain` - configures the default domain template in case the hostname is not set during product creation with options
  - `enabled` - specifies if feature is enabled
  - `mask` - the domain template in format `*.domain.tld` where `*` will be replaced with `vps-{serviceId}` when product is created
